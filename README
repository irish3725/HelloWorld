This is a repository full of things that I'm using to learn
c++. So far there's just a simple HelloWorld and a dice 
rolling game. 

How to compile and run. Since these are still very simple, g++ must
be used instead of gcc.

g++ <filename.cc>
./a.out


helloworld:
    Prints "Hello World"

cpr:
    Asks how to spell CPR and waits for input. Used it to 
    learn how to take inputs, compare strings, and use if
    statements and while loops.

dice:
    Rolls rolls dice. Not much else so far.
